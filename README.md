# Image Compression using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in MATLAB

This project implements image compression using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique in MATLAB. It demonstrates how wavelet-based methods can efficiently reduce image size while preserving visual quality.

## 📌 Features

- Compression using single-level 2D DWT
- Support for grayscale image compression
- Wavelet decomposition using standard MATLAB functions
- PSNR and Compression Ratio evaluation
- Visualization of original, compressed, and reconstructed images

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- MATLAB (tested with R2021a and above)
- Wavelet Toolbox
